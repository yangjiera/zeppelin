        <h4><b>Call for Tutorials</b></h4>
        <p>ACM UMAP 2018 is pleased to invite proposals for tutorials to be given in conjunction with the conference.
        Tutorials are intensive instructional sessions that provide a comprehensive introduction to established or emerging research topics of interest for the UMAP community.</p>
        <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        <li>new user modeling technologies, methods, techniques, and trends (e.g. exploiting data mining and big data analytics for user modeling, evaluation methodologies, data visualization, etc.)</li>
        <li>user modeling and personalization techniques for specific domains (e.g., health sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage, education, internet of things, mobile, music, information retrieval, etc.)</li>
        <li>application of user modeling and personalization techniques for information retrieval and recommender systems;</li>
        <li>eliciting and learning user preferences by taking into account usersâ€™ emotional state, physical state, personality, trust, cognitive factors.</li>
        <li>The ideal tutorial should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen area, but it should also cover the most important topics in depth.</li></p>

        <br/>
        <h5><b>PROPOSAL FORMAT AND SUBMISSION</b></h5>
        <p>Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, and should contain the following information:

        <li> Tutorial description:<br/>
            - learning objectives of the tutorial and relevance to UMAP 2018;<br/>
            - a brief outline of the tutorial structure;<br/>
            - targeted audience (introductory, intermediate, advanced) and prerequisite knowledge or skills;<br/>
            - practical sessions.
        <li> Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full (6 hours) or half day (3 hours).<br/>
