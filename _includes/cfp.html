        <!--h4><b>Call for Papers</b></h4-->
        <h5><b>SUBMISSIONS</b></h5>
            <p><b>Papers should be submitted through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmumap2018" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmumap2018</a>.</b></p>

            <p>The User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (UMAP) 2018 Conference will include high quality peer-reviewed papers related to the above key areas. Maintaining the high quality and impact of the UMAP series, each paper will have three reviews by program committee members and a meta-review presenting the reviewers’ consensual view; the review process will be coordinated by the program chairs in collaboration with the corresponding area chairs.</p>

            <p>Long (8 pages + references) and Short (4 pages + references) papers in ACM style Peer reviewed, original, and principled research papers addressing both the theory and practice of UMAP and papers showcasing innovative use of UMAP and exploring the benefits and challenges of applying UMAP  technology in real-life applications and contexts are welcome.</p>

            <p>Long papers should present original reports of substantive new research techniques, findings, and applications of UMAP. They should place the work within the field and clearly indicate innovative aspects. Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. Results should be clearly communicated and implications of the contributions/findings for UMAP and beyond should be explicitly discussed.</p>

            <p>Short papers should present original and highly promising research or applications. Merit will be assessed in terms of originality and importance rather than maturity, extensive technical validation, and user studies.</p>

            <p>Separation of long and short papers will be strictly enforced so papers will not compete across categories, but only within each category. Papers that receive high scores and are considered promising by reviewers, but didn’t make the acceptance cut, will be directed to the poster session of the conference and will be invited to be resubmitted as posters.
            </p>

        <h5><b>TRACKS</b></h5>
            <h6><b>Personalized Recommender Systems</b></h6>
            <p>Dietmar Jannach, TU Dortmund, Germany &lt;<a href="mailto: dietmar.jannach@cs.tu-dortmund.de">dietmar.jannach@cs.tu-dortmund.de</a>&gt; <br />
            Markus Zanker, Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, Italy &lt;<a href="mailto: Markus.Zanker@unibz.it">Markus.Zanker@unibz.it</a>&gt;</p>

            <p>Personalized, computer-generated recommendations have become a pervasive feature of today’s online world. The underlying recommender systems are designed to help users and providers in a number of ways. From a user’s viewpoint, for example, these systems assist consumers in finding relevant things within large item collections. On the other hand, from a provider’s perspective, recommenders have also shown to be valuable tools to steer consumer behavior. From a technical perspective, the design of such systems requires the careful consideration of various aspects, including the choice of the user modeling approach, the underlying recommendation algorithm, and the user interface. This track aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss open challenges, latest solutions and novel research approaches in the field of recommender systems. Besides the above-mentioned technical aspects, works are also particularly welcome that address questions related to the user perception and the business value of recommender systems.</p>

            <h6><b>Adaptive Hypermedia and the Semantic Web</b></h6>

            <p>Adaptive hypermedia and adaptive web explore alternatives to the traditional “one-size-fits-all” approach in the development of web and hypermedia systems. Adaptive hypermedia and adaptive web systems build a model of the interests, preferences and knowledge of each individual user, and use this model in order to adapt the behavior of hypermedia and web systems to the needs of that user. Semantic web frequently serves as an infrastructure to enable adaptive and personalized Web systems. Semantic web technology targets the use of explicit semantics and metadata to help web systems perform the desired functionality: this implies the use of linked data from the web, the use of ontologies in models, or the use of metadata in user interfaces. This track aims to provide a forum to researchers to discuss open research problems, solid solutions, latest challenges, novel applications and innovative research approaches in adaptive hypermedia and semantic web.</p>

            <h6><b>Intelligent User Interfaces</b></h6>

            <p>Intelligent User Interfaces aim to improve the interaction between computer systems and human users by means of Artificial Intelligence. The systems support and complement different types of abilities that are normally unavailable in the context of human-only cognition. Previous work has found that humans do not always make the best possible decisions when working together with computer systems. By designing and deploying improved forms of support for interactive collaboration between human decision makers and systems, we can enable decision making processes that better leverage the strengths of both collaborators. More generally this research track can be characterised by exploring how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter and more productive, which may leverage solutions from human-computer interaction, data mining, natural language processing, information visualisation, and knowledge representation and reasoning.</p>

            <h6><b>Technology-Enhanced Adaptive Learning</b></h6>

            <p>Learning is a very complex human process that involves cognitive, affective and psychomotor aspects. Smart technological solutions are expected to identify and model the learning needs in these three aspects and provide personalized adapted support that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning experiences. Technological innovations bring new opportunities to recognize learner’s needs and how to orchestrate suitable learning solutions, with and without the involvement of the teacher. This covers not only formal educational settings, but also lifelong learning requirements (including workplace training) as well as the acquisition of skills (e.g., in daily activities, serious games, etc.).</p>
            <p>To address the wide spectrum of modeling issues and challenges that can be raised,  contributions from various research areas are necessary. Therefore, this track invites researchers, developers, and practitioners from various disciplines to present their innovative learning solutions, share acquired experience, and discuss the main modeling challenges for personalized adaptive learning.

            <p>The massive uptake of numerous social media platforms on the web gave rise the Social Web, where people can obtain, disseminate and share information, interact, collaborate and form communities (social networks), through a variety of means. A number of research questions arise, for example how to model the flow of information through the social web, understand people’s experiences and the effectiveness of online social networks, identify users or communities with behaviour potentially harmful to themselves or others, gain insights into society, or design, develop and evaluate automated personalization tools to improve the individual user experience.</p>
